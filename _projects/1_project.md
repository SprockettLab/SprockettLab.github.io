Why focus on babies? This early period represents a critical window for immune training, metabolic programming, and developmental processes that set the stage for lifelong health. Our research integrates microbial ecology, host-microbe interactions, and genome evolution to identify the processes that shape our microbiome from birth. Our goal is to identify the ecological and evolutionary forces that underlie early colonization, succession, and stabilization of the microbiome — and how these processes may vary across individuals, populations and cultures, and even host species.
