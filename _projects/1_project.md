> _Uncovering how infant gut communities take shape, and why microbiome assembly in early-life matters for lifelong health._

The earliest stages of life are a critical window for microbiome development, when microbial communities colonize the infant gut and establish long-lasting ecological relationships. Perturbations during this period—such as antibiotic exposure, diet shifts, or delivery mode—can have profound consequences for immune maturation and metabolic health. Our lab investigates how microbial communities assemble during this formative stage, using longitudinal sampling, ecological modeling, and experimental manipulations to uncover the principles that govern early-life microbiome stability. By integrating host physiology with microbial ecology, we aim to identify the key drivers of healthy microbiome assembly and the vulnerabilities that may predispose individuals to disease later in life {% cite sprockett2020microbiota %}.
