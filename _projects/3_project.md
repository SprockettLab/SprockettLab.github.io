> _Tracking evolutionary change in the microbiome to understand adaptation, resilience, and host health._

The microbiome is a dynamic, constantly evolving system. Microbial populations adapt to shifting diets, immune pressures, antibiotics, and ecological interactions within the host {% cite sprockett2025recent sprockett2023home %}. These selective forces can drive rapid genetic changes, from point mutations to horizontal gene transfer, reshaping microbial functions in ways that influence host physiology. Our lab investigates these evolutionary dynamics by combining experimental models with comparative genomics, tracking how microbial lineages diversify, compete, and adapt over time. By studying evolution within the microbiome, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that generate resilience, vulnerability, and functional innovation in microbial ecosystems, ultimately linking microbial genetic change to host health and disease.
