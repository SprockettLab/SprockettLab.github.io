Dr. Daniel Sprockett is a microbial ecologist and evolutionary biologist who studies the assembly, evolution, and function of the gut microbiota across host lifespans. He earned his Master’s degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology under Chris Blackwood and Helen Piontkivska, and went on to earn his PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from Stanford University School of Medicine in 2019, where he worked with Dr. David Relman to investigate patterns and processes of community assembly in the human microbiome, including pioneering work on gut microbiota maturation in indigenous Tsimane communities of the Bolivian Amazon. He completed postdoctoral training at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School with Dr. Seth Rakoff-Nahoum, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at Cornell University with Dr. Andrew Moeller, where he also served as a Distinguished Scholar at the Cornell Center for Vertebrate Genomics and a Fellow at the Cornell Institute of Host-Microbe Interactions and Disease. During his time at Cornell, he uncovered widespread ancient rodent-bacterial symbioses and provided the first experimental demonstration that gut microbiota are locally adapted to their hosts. In January 2025, Dr. Sprockett joined the faculty at Wake Forest University School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology.
